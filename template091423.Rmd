I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1: First code chunk

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2: Make a plot

This code is borrowed from the last lecture; it creates a dataframe for plotting.

```{r}
plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000, sd = .5),
  y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(1000)
)
```

Next up is a histogram of the 'x' variable in 'plot_df'.

```{r}
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x)) + geom_histogram()
```

# Section 3: Learning assessment

Here is a test data frame from the learning assessment:

```{r learning_assessment_1}
example_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(500, mean = 1),
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
  abs_norm_samp = abs(norm_samp)
)
```
